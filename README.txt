Implemented a DFA and NFA and a function for translating between NFA and DFA.

As for the patterns that I found interesting:
	I tested my DFA to recognize the pattern that a float represents.
	I tested my NFA to recognize the patterns that numeric inputs including floats


The DFA is represented in the file dfa.c
The NFA is represented in the file nfa.c
The translated DFA is represented in the file cDFA.c

All files have accompanying header files that explain functionality.

I would like to give credit to Prof. George Ferguson for the code he provided to represent Sets. Sets were crucial to implementing the translation function found in nfa.c

I used xCode to write the project and used all the setting prescribed by the instructor


TO RUN THE PROJECT:

Import the whole folder into your IDE
And then just run the main.c file! 

ALTERNATIVELY alternatively to run the program in terminal there is also a unix executable file found in the cmake-debug ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿folder that one requires to be double clicked on to run the program
